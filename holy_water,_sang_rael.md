# Holy Water, Sang Rael

```
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness 
was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God       SHE KIN AH   
moved upon the face of the waters.                         ----------
                                                           EVE RY ONE
And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

Genesis 1:1-3
```

##Holy Water is *people*
This is a baptism, or at least what that concept metaphorically refers to, it's a shock with cold *water*, seeing that something so obvious has been hidden from the world *and absolutely nobody noticed.*  Like Soy*lent* Green, a cinematic tool to understand how water is people, Biblically, references to the sea, and *walking on people* (wow) are both clear as clues.  Christ walks on people to deliver this Revelation, it is my will--and His--to ensure that we do not lose the truth or our freedom.  There is no choice, hence, *walking on water.*  
```
And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together 
of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.

Gensis 1:10
```
You should have read about Ground, Earth, and **Adam**ah in [*The Tower of Babel*](https://adjkjc.gitbooks.io/time-and-chance/content/the_tower_of_babel.html).

##Mary and the Whymar Republic

Mar is **sea** in Spanish, there's significant Biblical correlation between Spanish words and hidden meaning, like [Navidad and Christmas](the_letter_why.html) and the names [Jesus and Elisha.](the_tower_of_babel.html).  It's about the *Bride of Revelation* being *All Humianity* allah the "sea" and "ah."  All three of the names that make up the sea of Revelation are rough descriptions of "everyone," the Spirit of God, everyone, and the planet.  The **SEA** of Eden begins to reveal how **family** is related to the *waters of the deep.*
```
From the S E A of Eden, to the multitude of Revelation.

Taylor Momsen sings that "everyone must be saved."  There is a huge secret message in the Bible, one that literally spans from Eden in Genesis to the multitude in Revelation.  Its about the "sea" short for Seth,Eve,Adam in the beginning, and expanding.  Holy water is people is the beginning of the Holy Grail.  Asherah of course, is discussed in [*He Laughs, again*](hamd.md/he_laughs.html).  Like the **FisherKing** that asks "POF or King?" Asherah asks: "Ash.... or All Humanity?"

```
The dragon stood on the shore of the sea. And I saw a beast 
coming out of the sea.

Revelation 13

Then I saw another angel coming up from the east, having the 
seal of the living God. He called out in a loud voice to the
four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the 
sea: 3 “Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees ...

After this I looked, and there before me was a 
great multitude that no one could count, from 
every nation, tribe, people and language, 
standing before the throne and before the Lamb.

Revelation 7

He was holding a little scroll, which lay open in his hand.
He planted his right foot on the sea and his left 
foot on the land.

Revelation 10
```

And so, walking on water, the Lamb gives you a little scroll.


Add in the Plague of Water to Blood (from Exodus, a "Blessing in Disguise"), and the multitude turns to the family of Christ.  I call this message the Holy Grail, like the cup that contains Jesus' blood.  The cup is the Earth, when you see moving the "h" to the beginning makes it Heart.. a Heart filled with blood.  

```
But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart and he would not 
listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said to Moses.

Exodus 9:12
```
*Hardening* is a computer term for increasing security.  This is a reference to hiding this world in Heaven, keeping us from being seen.  Hardening the security of the world.

```
Then the Lord said to Moses, “Pharaoh’s heart is unyielding; 
he refuses to let the people go. 15 Go to Pharaoh in 
the morning as he goes out to the river.  

Exodus 7:AD

This is what the Lord says: By this you will know that 
I am the Lord: With the staff that is in my hand 
I will strike the water of the Nile, and it will be 
changed into blood.

Exodus 7:14
```

I have a message to Taylor, **you're right** might you see how you can be the match that lights Jim Morrison's fire.  For more on the *fire spreading* share this book with a neighbor, or read [*Music Saves All Souls*](music_saves_all_souls.html).

That's Jimmy "More, I son.." with pockets full of [*wisdom*  A message that intertwines The Doors, Spin Doctors, 3 Doors Down, and The Pretty Reckless to reveal a story about Superman.](the_lamb_of_god.html) gaining wisdom from the crystals of Jor-El; through a process designed to create the crucifixion, a cross of [American Injustice--to change the world.](the_light_of_heaven.html)

I mentioned her song, **Burn**, she says she "can't find her door" which links to another message of Christ.   The Iron Rod read backwards is tied to the band The Doors; named after gateways to Heaven that are secretly prophesied to come .... soon.  I haven't seen mine either, but the message of the Rod is that it is juxtaposed to Aarons "let my people go" through the periodic table symbol for Iron..

```
Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and say to him, 
'This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says: "Let 
my people go, so that they may worship me."

Exodus 9:1

And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a
potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of 
my Father. he shall.

Revelation 2:27
```

I should metion again, The Doors are singing about the Plagues of Egypt.  Listen to ["Peace Frog," It's about *blood in the streets.*](https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=peace+frog+the+doors&qpvt=peace+frog+the+doors&FORM=VDRE)

###Doors, ***F***or ***e***veryone.  

The story goes that I said Jesus couldn't exist, because he would *never **rule** for a thousand years with an Iron Rod*.  Being born in America, as Queen sings "here we are, born to be Kings" I changed my mind about the rod, when it became a key to the Doors.

The Ash of Adam: my tattoo of Eden; Adam, Sigma (for the summation of everyone) in the Heart.

OUI, "we are."  That's the lil'ah (of Delilah) *walking on water.*  *Pa u art of Heaven (l).*  And the "Road to **A**damaskus" is getting clearler.  For those that say I ((ish)) too much, believe... I **Amish**.

And I think it's writring like this that has turned people off for so so long, I see it *filled with **#EarlyLight***.  Did I start a sentence with "and?"  It's for effect.

```
 Out there, no food or drink
 How many days do you think youd last
 On your diamonds and your pearls?
 Im not a king, no, not a hero, not a fool
 I'm not perfect, I'm flesh and bone
 And I'm exactly what you need

Dave Matthews Band, Squirm

In God's capable hands, **"we are."**
