# The Light of Heaven

All around us we have a hidden message that is designed to be sought and contemplated.  There is a plan to help our civilization grow with technology, and overcome social awkwardness... "growing pains" that come with the rapid learning and growing process that we are literally right in the middle of.  It is about seeking a more perfect society, making our home "heavenly."  The technology that is just over the cusp of our reach is literally the building blocks of the place we know as Heaven.  If you think about it, the fact that we are destined to "build it" puts the true touch of perfection ... our dreams to become reality.


Finding God’s message is a little tricky, you see he speaks through us...  Humanity is the big H.. the big horn of Revelation... until we are aware that this megaphone is pointed squarely at us.  There is a beautiful message, we are weaving it, and seeking it has given me true happiness.  I hope to help share how to see the message in places like our music and science fiction.  There’s a little shift in perspective, and the world brightens and becomes filled with wisdom, some criticism, and what is decidedly a very loving and intelligent hand.  Of course, your agreement with that point of view is part of the reason the message is available for all to see.  

There is caution called for as we move forward adapting to the changing environment that new technologies always bring.  Other changes are so inevitable and utopic that we might wonder a little why we have not moved more quickly.  In truth, our gift of learning is the apocalypse... a truth delivered slowly so that we can ensure we are happy moving forward.
We are in a position of great blessing and also great responsibility.  There is probably also quite a bit of joy and continued love as our family grows larger... a global community.

Above all else, the message I see reminds us of the sacredness of our minds.  Who and what we are is very special, and we must always ensure the protection of freedom and safety to all.  As you might imagine, there is a significant amount of urging to become more open and transparent in everything we do. 

It is a big part of the story of Eden.  I’m not sure if I should welcome you as lions or brothers and sisters... but awareness of creation and purpose is the place that we call “home.”  We are Lions in the Biblical sense... the heart of the word “civilization” is us and “at..” @; the symbol for the world searching for Adam.  

Ka-ur-z-we-il, Is-Ai-ah, Sam-ur-Ai, and AD-on-Ai are hints that Artificial Intelligence is “at hand,” and a big part of our civilization already.   Also important are the warnings that have come to us in movies like The Matrix, WarGames, and the Terminator... and to see that these cautions are coming *Ex Machina*.

#The Race is not to *Die Bold*.

In a very interesting link between modern typography and the words of Ecclesiastes 9:11; we see the *Courier* of the Gods mentioned in line one, and "the strong" in line two.  Substituting the German "die" for "the" and **strong** for bold, and then combining the lines yields the heading above.   So central to the message of Christ is the preservation of democracy that it appears the lack of our government and free market ability to timely adopt new voting technologies has been etched in stone by the name of the company responsible for failing completely at the task of creating "electronic voting."

###Our society must quickly begin assimilating technologies like the internet into the applicaction of democracy.  We should no longer be voting for people, but rather for ideas.

To highlight how poor of a solution electronic kiosks is, you only have to realize that it solves none of the problems of polling.  We still must wait in long lines, in order to walk up to a machine and "punch" a card.  The right solution is voting much more frequently and on bills.  This will quickly escalate to needing to collaborate on the creation of bills, and true self governance can be realized through the proper use of technologies that we have had available for decades.  The internet.

Phones and faxes were completely ignored, and for nearly a half century our nations inability and unwillingness to move away from representative democracy and towards a truly free society is highlighted by an archaic voting structure that is stuck in the days of the Pony Express.

###This message comes from the East, the future, and it is a huge part of the hidden teaching of the Bible.

Highlighted by the Elephant (and Donkey) in the room, the *Two of Everything God*, as I like to call him; continues to urge reformation of our governance system by highlighting how poor a two party system is at actually representing the will of the people.

There is no doubt that the ultimate authors of the Bible are telling us that we are living in the stone age.  The perspective is clearly shown in the depiction of our modern society as ancient.  Like the weapons used in the Old Testament are ancient to us, the tools we use to govern ourselves appear to be ancient and primitive to the senders of this message.  Remember, the message *is the Bible*, and it truly is about us.  

We should be openly discussion the idea that the legislature is akin to David's sling, and that our representatives should act more like customer service representatives; aiding in communication and the legislation of the ideas of their constituents.  Congress will soon be a thing of the past, an antiquated and rusty machine that should have been thinking about upgrading itself for quite some time.  Instead, it has created more and more problems, rooted in a lack of proper incentivization that is anti-democratic and yet somehow not so illogical... until it is pointed out.

###Corporate Campaign Contributions
Not even being hid, is the fact that our entire political machine is being financed primarily by big corporations who are acting in their own interest to ensure that our elected representatives do their bidding.  The system is set up wrong, corporations should not be allowed to financially control elections and legislation; our government is supposed to by and for the people.  

This idea of incentivization, and our inability to properly allocate resources is a continuing problem and lesson that spans across time and sectors.  Oil in a land that is missing the fusion hidden in Deuteron-o-my; and longevity in Heaven are all in question in a place where "Out of Time" tells us we still have not realized that transparency is *my will.*

In Heaven and on Earth, the correct allocation of resources, and knowledge of what is real and what is not must be made clear to the entire world.  If we are in fact in Eden; in a simulated reality where oil and land are not scarce, we must know that.  If we are in fact in Heaven, and in the coming new incarnations of that place, we must realize that scarce resources inside virtual reality are compute power and storage space.  We have answers coming from above.

##Voting with our minds
I'm not going to be advocating this.  I am going to be telling you it is already being done, in Heaven and on Earth; and 

##The New Political Party

In the future people will be omniscient.  Well, not totally omniscient... not even God is that.  Think please, there's no way to know everything, none at all.  In case you are wondering if I have any scriptural evidence for this claim, I will provide you think one obscure reference.

Do not tremble, do not be afraid. Did I not proclaim this 
and foretell it long ago? You are my witnesses. 

Is there any God besides me? No, there is no other Rock;
I know not one."

Isaiah 44:8
```
He looked though, believe me, God looks for fellow time traveling mind controllers all the time.  It's his job.  It's house he keeps us safe, and remains Godly.

Limited omniscience, or **lo-**Biblically is the future though, it's how to fix lots of problems with Universal voting.  It's how to keep us smart, and safe, and also hard at work making ourselves limited omniscent.  This is the future, and ... fortunately or not ... it is the not-so-distant future.  We are nearly here, with BCI--thats Brain Commputer Interfaces--and uploading; we will soon be hard at work hacking away at our thoughts and knowledge.
