##What goes up must come down?

```
And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven 
to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and 
for seasons, and for days, and years:

Genesis: 1:AD

There was a great earthquake. The sun turned black like sackcloth
made of goat hair, the whole moon turned blood red, and the 
stars in the sky fell to earth, as figs drop from a fig tree when
shaken by a strong wind.

Revelation 6:12-13
```

##The *You and I* *verse*, my Universe

```
I'm gonna love you 
Till the heavens stop the rain 
I'm gonna love you 
Till the stars fall from the sky for you and I 
 
The Doors, Touch Me
```

##And the Fire

```
The heavens receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every
mountain and island was removed from its place.

Revelation 6:AD

God is a consuming fire.

2 Peter 3:10

believe not in Allah and His Messenger, He has prepared, 
for those who reject Allah, a Blazing Fire!" 

Koran 48:13

surely i see fire; i will bring to you from it some news, 
or i will bring to you therefrom a burning firebrand so 
that you may warm yourselves.

See, the LORD is coming with fire, and his chariots are like a whirlwind; he will bring down his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.
